# Open Source LLM

## About This Fork

This repository is a personal fork of the official [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) project. It exists to experiment with large language models in a local environment. The code is provided without any guarantee of stability or performance and is not intended for production use.

**Important:** Use this repository at your own risk. For a stable and supported implementation, see the original [DeepSeek-V3 repository](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3).

## Goals

- **Learning** – explore the inner workings of LLMs and their deployment.
- **Experimentation** – try optimizations for lightweight, local usage.
- **Community Contribution** – share findings with other developers.

## Quick Start

Setup largely follows the instructions from the official project. Refer to their documentation for installation and usage details. This fork may contain experimental changes.
